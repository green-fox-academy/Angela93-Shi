            <p> Take this speech for example. I wanted to enter this competition,
                but I would feel very embarrassed if I made mistakes. Just then, 
                I thought about my dream. My dream is to become a scientist when I grow up. 
                If I am not confident, how can I overcome difficulties I face? If I am not confident, 
                how can I succeed in developing myself in the future? I will do it! Today, 
                I am making a speech in public and I feel proud and confident!
